Jean Helfenstein // Leap Experiment


///////////////////////////////////


You can find here the source code for my experiment with the Leap Motion Device and Javascript.

These are experiments, so I will not bother too much about code cleaning and all that.


// 01 : Cubes

The first experiment uses the leap data to show 3d cubes on the screen.



Some experiments uses the great Three.js Library to render the 3d.
